TTTSoundBoard

A simple Java Program I wrote a while back that, upon execution, opens
a simple GUI featuring a number of button objects. When clicking any one
of the buttons, it will play the audio corresponding to the button object.

This project was my first time playing around with Swing and Java's audio
libraries. 

Languages/Tools Used
-Java

Issues
-none known

Planned Features
-Ability to add sounds to the board without modifying code
Queueing audio files and playing them back to back
Swapping default mic to stereo mix and back (for use in VoIP calls)
